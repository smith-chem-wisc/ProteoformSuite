\section{Aggregated Proteoforms}
overview of what's going on here (combining proteoform observations, both for identification and quantification)

\begin{itemize}
	\item What these represent
	\item What is an identification component (mass, retention time, and also lysine count if available)
	\item What is an verification component (uses algorithm for bundling quant components in, i.e. not including lysine count)
	\item What is an quantification component (doesn't consider lysine count)
	\item E\# accessions are stable across runs with the same data files
	\item options: significance; when would you adjust them
	\item how to see the components that were bundled (click on the proteoform)
	\item Notes on column headers
	\item Manual validation information
\end{itemize}
