\section{Visualizing Proteoform Families in Cytoscape}
Example viz, why it's revealing and what we can learn

\subsection{Cytoscape}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is cytoscape (cite)
	\item Installation
	\item Installing enhancedGraphics app
	\item Version requirements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generating Cytoscape Scripts in Proteoform Suite}
\begin{itemize}
	\item what buttons to push in Families and Quant in PS
	\item Overview of the 4 files that are output (edges, nodes, style.xml, script)
	\item Cytoscape sessions (.cys) are portable between folders and computers. This script is not. They reference absolute paths of the other files.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building Families in Cytoscape}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Running the script (Tools -> Execute command file)
	\item Should finish within 1 min for beautiful visualization
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exporting Family Visualizations into Illustrator}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Export as image -> SVG
	\item This will export everything in view, but nothing else into a format that can be loaded by illustrator and polished there for publication
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Known Cytoscape Bugs and Quirks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Exchanging cytoscape session files causes styles to be shuffled. Will need to reselect the style with dropdown
	\item Tooltip doesn't wrap, but ``more info'' includes a bunch of useful information. You can access this by clicking on a node and copying the ``more info'' cell into a word document.
\end{itemize}
