\section{Proteoform Families}
What's a proteoform family

\subsection{Constructing Families}
How we use relations to form families
\begin{itemize}
	\item Table overview (click on boxes to get various tables below (exp prot, relations, etc))
	\item Inclusion lists for targeted top-down
	\item How to view raw ET histogram, what that means
	\item How to view decoy histograms and what that means
	\item Gene-centric families combine all products of the same gene. Unchecking the box forms families with respect to UniProt accession, i.e. protein parent.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identifying Proteoforms}
How we trace families to identify proteoforms
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can specify likely cleavages that should be favored over others (Ile, Leu, Ala in yeast).
	\item Look back to theoretical database for more options
	\item Proteoform FDR, what it means, how it's calculated
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cytoscape Displays}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Example visualization (identification w/o pie charts)
	\item How to make visualizations, options for customizing viz
	\item explain different builds available in PS GUI
\end{itemize}
