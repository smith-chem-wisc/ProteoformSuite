\section*{Project Overview}

Proteoform Suite is a user interface for the analysis of intact proteoform MS data. The source-code is openly available at \url{https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/proteoform-suite}. This software identifies and quantifies proteoforms by comparing intact mass and lysine count for each observed proteoform to all theoretical proteoforms generated from known protein sequences and annotated PTMs. These comparisons reveal both exact-mass matches and mass differences characteristic of known PTMs. The program also quantifies relative proteoform abundances between two conditions by calculating intensity ratios for each identified proteoform. Finally, it streamlines the visualization of proteoform abundance changes and PTM relationships in the program Cytoscape. The display of constellations of proteoforms can be examined to better understand the biological changes measured in the MS experiment.
