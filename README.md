Elucidating _Escherichia coli_ Proteoform Families Using Intact-Mass Proteomics and a Global PTM Discovery Database. [(2017, _J. Proteome Res._)](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00516)
* The version used for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/ProteoformSuite/releases/tag/0.1.12).

## Functionality
* Proteoform Identification: Proteoform are identified from measurements of intact mass and lysine count.
* Custom Database: PTMs archived and UniProt and discovered using [G-PTM-D](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/gptmd) or [MetaMopheus](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus) are used in the construction of theoretical proteoforms.
* Quantification: NeuCode-labeled proteoform intensity ratios are calculated from separate analysis files following proteoform identification.
* Gene Ontology Analysis: Performed alongside quantification based on proteoforms that are significantly induced or repressed. GO terms are obtained from UniProt protein annotations.
* Visualization: ProteoformSuite facilitates the visualization of the relationships between proteoforms by creating scripts to load in the network visualization program Cytoscape. 

### Requirements

The following files must be obtained and installed:

* uniprot.xml: A UniProt reference database in .xml format

  [http://www.uniprot.org](http://www.uniprot.org)

* ptmlist.txt: A PTM library
 
  [http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist.txt](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist.txt) 

* for thermo .RAW files: [Thermo MSFileReader](https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/search?query=MSFileReader)
