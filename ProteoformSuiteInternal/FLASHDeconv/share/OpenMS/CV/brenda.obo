The hypothalamus may be divided into five regions or areas (area hypothalamica rostralis\, area hypothalamica dorsalis\, area hypothalamica intermedia\, area hypothalamica lateralis and area hypothalamica posterior) or into three longitudinal zones (periventricular zone\, medial zone\, and lateral zone). The hypothalamic nuclei constitute that part of the corticodiencephalic mechanism that activates\, controls and integrates the peripheral autonomic mechanisms\, endocrine activity\, and many somatic functions\, e.g.\, a general regulation of water balance\, body temperature\, sleep\, and food intake\, and the development of secondary sex characteristics. The hypothalamus secretes vasopressin and oxytocin\, which are stored in the pituitary\, as well as many releasing factors (hypophysiotropic hormones)\, by means of which it exerts control over functions of the adenohypophysis."

Asynchronous muscle is only\nknown to occur in insects.

Enclosed entirely within the tegument cytoplasm of the tubercle are a series of spines\, made of actin\, which assist in gripping the blood vessel.\nThe tegument is normally closely apposed to the underlying circular muscle layer\, and separated from it only by an extracellular matrix of collagen fibres. The tubercle is the exception\,\nwhere the tegument is lifted up by numerous extensions of\nparenchymal cells. The parenchymal cell bodies lie below the muscle layers and send out narrow extensions of cytoplasm which insinuate between the muscles to form the packing for the tubercle." [University of York:R.A.

def: "Cells used by rays\, electric eels and other electric fish for electrogenesis and electroreception. They are flat disk-like cells that are stacked in a sequence in a manner similar to a battery. Electric eels have several thousand of these cells stacked\, each producing 0.15V. The cells function by pumping positive sodium and potassium ions out of the cell via transport proteins powered by adenosine triphosphate. Postsynaptically\, electrocytes work much like muscle cells. They have nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These cells are used in research because of their resemblance to nerve-muscle junctions.\nLocation\: In the electric ray Torpedo\, electroplax are found near the pectoral muscles and the gills. In all other fishes\, it is often near the tail. In one fish genus\, the Malaptaturus\, the electric organs are not made of individual electroplax\, but are built up from charges of the epithelium\, specifically the skin."

The system is itself governed by the central nervous system and receives both parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation." [Medical Dictionary Online:http\://www.online-medical-dictionary.org]

def: "Neuroendocrine cells are cells that receive neuronal input (neurotransmitters released by nerve cells) and\, as a consequence of this input\, release message molecules (hormones) to the blood. In this way they bring about and integration between the nervous system and the endocrine system\, a process known as neuroendocrine integration. An example of a neuroendocrine cell is the cell of the adrenal medulla (innermost part of the adrenal gland) which releases adrenalin to the blood. The adrenal medullary cells are controlled by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. These cells are modified postganglionic neurons. Autonomic nerve fibers lead directly to them from the central nervous system.\nThe major center of neuroendocrine integration in the body is found in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Here hypothalamic neurosecretory cells release factors to the blood. Some of these these factors\, release at the median eminence\, control the secretion of pituitary hormones\, while others (the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin) are released directly to the peripheral circulation."

Another location of brain stem cells occurs in the hippocampus\, a special structure of the cerebral cortex related to memory function. Stem cells isolated from these areas are able to divide and to give rise to nerve cells and neuron-supporting cell types in culture."

name: nidopallium
def: "The nidopallium\, meaning nested pallium\, is the region of the avian brain that is used mostly for some types of executive functions but also other higher cognitive tasks. The region was renamed to nidopallium in 2002 during the Avian Brain Nomenclature Consortium because the prior name suggested that the region was used for more primitive functions."

def: "HVC (formerly called the High Vocal Center) is a nucleus in the brain of the songbirds (order passeriformes) necessary for both the learning and the production of bird song. It is located in the lateral caudal nidopallium and has projections to both the direct and the anterior forebrain pathways. HVc was originally called the Hyperstriatum Ventrale\, pars caudale\, higher vocal centre or HVc. When the nomenclature of the avian brain was revised in 2004 these names were dropped."
