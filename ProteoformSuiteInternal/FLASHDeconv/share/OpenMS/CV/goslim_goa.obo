name: lyase activity
namespace: function
def: "Catalysis of the cleavage of C-C\, C-O\, C-N and other bonds by other means than by hydrolysis or oxidation\, or conversely adding a group to a double bond. They differ from other enzymes in that two substrates are involved in one reaction direction\, but only one in the other direction. When acting on the single substrate\, a molecule is eliminated and this generates either a new double bond or a new ring." [ISBN:0198547684, EC:4.-.-.-]
